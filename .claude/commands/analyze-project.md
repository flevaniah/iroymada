Analyze the NetoPlus codebase to understand:
1. **Project objectives** - What is this application trying to achieve?
2. **Current implementation status** - What features are complete, partially implemented, or missing?
3. **Next development priorities** - What should be worked on next based on the current state?

Please provide a comprehensive analysis covering:

## Business Domain Understanding
- Core business functionality and use cases
- Multi-tenant architecture implementation status
- Key user workflows and their completion state

## Technical Implementation Status
- Database schema completeness
- Authentication and authorization implementation
- Core feature development progress
- UI/UX implementation status

## Development Priorities
- Critical missing features that block core functionality
- Technical debt or architectural improvements needed
- Feature enhancements that would provide high business value
- Performance or scalability improvements

Focus on providing actionable insights that help prioritize the next development phases.
